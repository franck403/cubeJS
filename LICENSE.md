# Geoloup Non-Commercial License (GNCL) v1.2

**Copyright © 2025 Franck403 & Geoloup**

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated files (the “Software”), to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software, subject to the following conditions:

## 1. Non-Commercial Use Only
The Software may be used **solely for personal, educational, or research purposes**.  
Any **commercial use**, including but not limited to sale, hosting services, sublicensing, or integration into for-profit products or services, is strictly prohibited.

## 2. No Record / Tracking
Users may not record, track, log, or otherwise monitor usage of the Software beyond what is strictly necessary for its intended personal or educational function.  
Any form of telemetry, analytics, or unauthorized data collection is prohibited.

## 3. Competition or World Record Useage
The Software may **can be used for competitions, tournaments, speed records, world record attempts, or any official or unofficial record submissions** of any kind but you need to reference to Franck403 as a member.
Any results produced with the Software are eligible for submission to record-keeping bodies or competitions that require original/unmodified work.

## 4. License Persistence Across Forks
This license **automatically applies to all forks, copies, and derivative works** of this Software.  
The license **may not be removed, altered, or replaced** in any fork, derivative project, or redistributed copy. Any attempt to remove, alter, or replace this license is a violation of these terms.

## 5. Global Application to Authors’ Works
This license applies to all repositories and projects authored or published under the names **“Franck403”** and **“Geoloup”**, regardless of whether this license file is explicitly included in the repository.  
Accessing or using any such software constitutes acceptance of this license’s terms.

## 6. Mandatory Integrity of `secure.js`
A file named **`secure.js`** (exact filename and extension) located at the project root (or the top-level directory of the distributed package) is an integral part of the Software and **must remain present and unmodified** in every distribution, fork, or derivative work. Specifically:
- **Prohibition on removal:** `secure.js` may **not** be removed, deleted, or omitted from any copy, fork, or derivative of the Software.
- **Prohibition on modification:** `secure.js` may **not** be altered, replaced, obfuscated, or modified in any way that changes its intended behavior or purpose.
- **Prohibition on concealment:** `secure.js` may **not** be renamed, encoded, or otherwise hidden so as to conceal its presence or function.
- **Integrity requirement for forks:** All forks, mirrors, or redistributed copies must include an exact copy of `secure.js`. Any distribution missing an unmodified `secure.js` is a material breach of this license.
- **Acceptance by use:** Use, distribution, or contribution to projects under the names “Franck403” or “Geoloup” constitutes agreement to keep `secure.js` intact and unmodified.

## 7. No Warranty
The Software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement.  
In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

## 8. Remedies for Breach
Any breach of the requirements in this license — including removal, modification, or concealment of `secure.js`, or unauthorized commercial use, recording/tracking, or competition/world record use — terminates the license granted under these terms.  
Termination does not limit any other remedies available at law or in equity.
